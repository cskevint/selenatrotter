		  	<h2>To Serve Humanity - Magazine</h2>
		  	<p>This magazine project was done out of my own passion for the Junior Youth Spiritual Empowerment Program. The basis of this program is to have young adults work with middle school aged children as mentors and friends for several years. These groups of junior youth are engaged in acts of service in their communities as well as working on developing themselves academically and socially. Before I started this magazine, there was a small flip book that had the same content, but simple images. I decided to turn these basic concepts into a more graphically appeaking magazine. All the images are from open source activities of people doing these same projects from all around the world. 
		  	Each concept was given one page in the magazine, with one picture to correspond with it. Readability was not the most important factor of this, as the magazine is used as a conversation piece where one person talks to another about the concepts and just uses the magazine as a show piece for the universality of this project.
		  	Here are four sample image speads from this 36 page magazine.</p>
